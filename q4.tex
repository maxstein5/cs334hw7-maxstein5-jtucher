\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] Under static scoping, the value of result() is 16. On line 3 in the function declaration \verb|let f = fun y -> x + y|, x takes the value 2 because that is how it was defined in the program text a line earlier, so whenever that function is called it will substitute 2 in for x. On line 5, x takes on the value 7 because it was defined as 7 in the previous line, making this the closest enclosing scope of the text. Same with line 6, where x takes on the value 7 based on the definition in line 4. Therefore the line \verb|x + f x| will evaluate to \verb|7 + (fun y -> 2 + y) 7 = 7 + 9 = 16|.

\item[(a)] Under dynamic scoping, x + f x would be 21, because the most recent value for x on the stack is 7, so the line \verb|x + f x = 7 + (fun y -> 7 + y) 7 = 7 + 7 + 7 = 21|. For line 3, x is 2, so the function f is defined \verb|let f = fun y -> 2 + y|, but then in line 5 and 6, the most recent definition on the stack has x as 7, so line 5 is \verb|7 +| and line 6 is \verb|x+ (fun y -> x + y) x| and 7 is substituted in for all xâ€™s.

\item[(a)] F\# uses static scope. One way I know is if we think about curried functions, and the type \verb|'a -> ( 'b -> 'c) |. We can imagine a curried function of this type, \verb|f x y|, and then imagine only passing it a value for x, meaning that it will return a function \verb| ( 'b -> 'c)|. We can then use this new function, and it will not be affected by associating x with a new stack frame. This implies that F\# is using the closest value in the program text, not the most recent on the stack.
